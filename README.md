### what is arbiter?

arbiter is a file manager app used in the terminal that *eventually* aims to:

- [x] File navigation
- [ ] Rename folders/files
- [ ] Move folders/files
- [ ] Delete folders/files
- [ ] Clean Terminal UI
- [ ] implement searching to reduce navigation movement

### why not just use terminal commands? 

arbiter's goal is to make file management convenient. </br>
I also suck at remembering where folders/files are and their paths

### A demo will be posted shortly, still ironing out some details

The order of tasks seen above does not reflect the order in which I will complete them, </br>
but most likely I will implement renaming since I think that will be the easiest.

Ascii ui is a pain in the butt, so that will be the last thing I do
